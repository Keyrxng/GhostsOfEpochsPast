# Addition of all current epochs from secureum
1. Gather material, jsonify the content of the epochs, find hashes and sumbit to contract.
2. Create NFT artwork for all epochs (2:1).
3. Handle metadata for NFT's.
4. Verify everything works as expected.

# Addition of CyberConnect for social features:
1. Learn and understand CyberConnect before beginning build.
2. Build CC Profile structure: IDDetails, RaceStats, SocialStats, Subscriptions, Achievements, PVPStats, Content.
3. Implement profile into current UI. (forget undeveloped features for now)
4. Build CC Profile social structure for "Connections" and "Followers".
5. Implement connections into the UI.
6. Design achievements.
7. Implement Achievements into the Profile UI.
8. Design security related content section.
9. Implement security related content section into UI.
10. Design PvP structure.
11. Implement PvP stats into Profile UI.

# Player vs Player theory:

As there are many new security researcher DAOs that are thriving due to the comradery and shared goal of improving their auditing skills. Often there are activities within these DAOs such as live CTF challenges. My vision is that through the collaboration of either one or more DAOs a form of pvp can be created wherein either users or DAOs battle each other through a series of CTF challenges.

If DAO vs DAO then the winner would be the accumulated points of the entire DAO. If User vs User then the winner would likely be the user with the most points over the course of the PVP activity. PVP would likely last a certain number of hours/challenges and would likely reset (or persist in some way) for the next PvP activity.

These events could be planned in advance to allow the scheduling, preparation and delivery of these events. Currently evmBrahim is hosting study sessions which users are rewarded a POAP for, this is essentially what we are trying to achieve but for community driven PVP events.

***Imagine*** 
* Web3SecurityDAO x Mis4nthr0picHQ: 6 part spot-the-bug CTF highest scoring DAO wins achievement for all DAO members that took part. Losers keep their participation POAP.
* GuardianAudits x TheSaloon: 2 part Pwn The DAO CTF. First DAO to complete both tasks wins the achievement for all DAO members that took part. Losers keep their participation POAP.

These types of PVP activities do not need to be solely focussed around CTF challenges. In future we could also experiment with a regular, pre-planned competition that would be based on user or DAO "ranks" or maybe "achievements". This could help a security DAO hone their skills for specific methodologies and events.

Study groups are commonplace and highly sought after so I believe that this could be a great idea to roll out, DAOs willing.

# Addition of Security Calender:
1. Create a way to either scan/grab/scrape these events for completion (harder but better) or manually compile an ongoing list of events updated weekly.
2. Any time based security event such as epoch registration, CTF competition, DAO secResearch PVP etc. should be listed here.
2. Create an interface for users to provide their own events.
